// If you want https, which is necessary for some Safari features,
// you need to install mkcert, which you can get here:
// https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert#installation
// and create a cert for your IP address or localhost
// and finally edit this file to reflect those values.
// Last step is to rename this file, just remove .https from the end.
